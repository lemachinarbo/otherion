# Aerion - An Open Source Lightweight E-Mail Client
Maintained by: @hkdb

![screenshot](docs/ss.png)


### ❓ Why?
---

Windows has Outlook

Mac has Mail

Linux has.....
 - Thunderbird - Clunky and too much legacy structure
 - Geary - Crippled by Gnome Online Accounts and search is unreliable
 - Mailspring - Electron...
 - Evolution - ... 1999

All are not necessarily always light on resource consumption...


### 👁️‍🗨️ Summary
---

A standalone lightweight e-mail client inspired by [Geary](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary) focused on achieving the following goals:

- Resource Efficiency - Minimal CPU, RAM, and battery consumption
- Modern UX - Clean, intuitive interface with dark mode support
- Keyboard & Mouse Friendly - Full keyboard navigation with vim-style shortcuts
- Independence - No dependency on Gnome Online Accounts or other system services
- Search That Works - Basic search that actually finds your emails
